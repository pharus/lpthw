Exercise 2
==========

```python
	# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
	# Anything after the # is ginored by python

	print "I could have code like this," # and the comment after is ignored

	# You can also use a comment do "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
	# print "This won't run."

	print "This will run."
```
It printed, as expected:
```bash
	I could have code like this,
	This will run.
```

Study drill:
1. As suspected, it is the way to comment in python. It's name is mistery, lots
   of contradictory information.

2. Reviewed it, indeed it is a good mechanism to detect errors. None found.

3. None found.

4. Didn't do this, kind of strange to be honest. Looks as the same, as the
   other except more jedi mind trick force way.
