Exercise 1
===========

```python
	print "Hello World!"
	print "Hello Again"
	print "I like typing this."
	print "This is fun."
	print 'Yay! Printing.'
	print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
	print 'I "said" do not touch this.'
```

It printed, as expected:
```bash
	Hello World!
	Hello Again
	I like typing this.
	This is fun.
	Yay! Printing.
	I'd much rather you 'not'.
	I "said" do not touch this.
```


Study drill:

1. Appended this line, it printed just one more line with "Yet another line"
```python 
	print "Yet another line"
```
2. Wrote just one line, and it printed its text
```python
	print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
```
3. The octothorpe makes python ignore the line, which is commonly known
   as a comment.
